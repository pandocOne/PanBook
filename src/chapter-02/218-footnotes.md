## 脚注

::: {.info caption="脚注"}
Pandoc's markdown 支持脚注功能，使用如 [@lst:footnote] 所示的语法。
:::

```{#lst:footnote .markdown caption="脚注语法"}
Here is a footnote reference,[^1] and another.[^longnote]

[^1]: Here is the footnote.

[^longnote]: Here's one with multiple blocks.

    Subsequent paragraphs are indented to show that they
belong to the previous footnote.

        { some.code }

    The whole paragraph can be indented, or just the first
    line.  In this way, multi-paragraph footnotes work like
    multi-paragraph list items.

This paragraph won't be part of the note, because it
isn't indented.
```

脚注参考用的 ID 不得包含空格、制表符或换行符。这些 ID 只会用来建立脚注位置与脚注文字的对应关连；在输出时，脚注将会依序递增编号。

脚注本身不需要放在文件的最后面。它们可以放在文件里的任何地方，但不能被放入区块元素（列表、引用、表格等）之中。每个脚注应与周围的内容（包括其他脚注）用空行隔开。

::: {.info caption="Extension: inline_notes"}
Pandoc 也支持行内脚注（尽管，与一般脚注不同，行内脚注不能包含多个段落）。其语法如下：

```markdown
Here is an inline note.^[Inlines notes are easier to write, since
you don't have to pick an identifier and move down to type the
note.]
```
:::

Here is an inline note.^[Inlines notes are easier to write, since
you don't have to pick an identifier and move down to type the
note.]

行内与一般脚注可以自由交错使用。
